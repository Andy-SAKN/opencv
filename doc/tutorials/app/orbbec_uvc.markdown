### Introduction
This tutorial is devoted to the Orbbec 3D cameras based on UVC protocol. For the use of the older Orbbec 3D which depends on OpenNI, please refer to the [previous tutorial](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/4.x/doc/tutorials/app/orbbec_astra_openni.markdown).

Unlike working with the OpenNI based Astra 3D cameras which requires OpenCV built with OpenNI2 SDK, Orbbec SDK is not required to be installed for accessing Orbbec UVC 3D cameras via OpenCV. By using `cv::VideoCapture` class, users get the stream data from 3D cameras, similar to working with USB cameras. The calibration and alignment of the depth map and color image are done internally.
### Instructions

In order to use the 3D cameras with OpenCV. You can refer to [Get Started](https://opencv.org/get-started/) to install OpenCV.

Note from 4.11 on, macOS users need to compile OpenCV from source with flag `-DOBSENSOR_USE_ORBBEC_SDK=ON` in order to use the cameras:
```bash
cmake -DOBSENSOR_USE_ORBBEC_SDK=ON ..
make
sudo make install
```
- For Mac users: 
  - **Python**:
    ```shell
    sudo python3 filename.py
    ```
    If prompted that a library is not installed, use `pip install` to install the necessary libraries. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
  - **C++**:
    During compilation, the options `-DAPPLE=ON` and `-DOBSENSOR_USE_ORBBEC_SDK=ON` need to be included.

- For Windows/Ubuntu users:
  - **Python**:
    Directly execute the script.
    
  - **C++**:
    Directly execute the compiled program.

### Code Explanation
#### Python

- **Open Orbbec Depth Sensor**:
  Using `cv.VideoCapture(0, cv.CAP_OBSENSOR)` to attempt to open the first Orbbec depth sensor device. If the camera fails to open, the program will exit and display an error message.

- **Loop to Grab and Process Data**:
  In an infinite loop, the code continuously grabs data from the camera. The `orbbec_cap.grab()` method attempts to grab a frame.

- **Process RGB Image**:
  Using `orbbec_cap.retrieve(None, cv.CAP_OBSENSOR_BGR_IMAGE)` to retrieve the RGB image data. If successfully retrieved, the RGB image is displayed in a window using `cv.imshow("BGR", bgr_image)`.

- **Process Depth Image**:
  Using `orbbec_cap.retrieve(None, cv.CAP_OBSENSOR_DEPTH_MAP)` to retrieve the depth image data. If successfully retrieved, the depth image is first normalized to a range of 0 to 255, then a false color image is applied, and the result is displayed in a window using `cv.imshow("DEPTH", color_depth_map)`.

- **Keyboard Interrupt**:
  Using `cv.pollKey()` to detect keyboard events. If a key is pressed, the loop breaks and the program ends.

- **Release Resources**:
  After exiting the loop, the camera resources are released using `orbbec_cap.release()`.
#### C++

- **Open Orbbec Depth Sensor**:
  Using `VideoCapture obsensorCapture(0, CAP_OBSENSOR)` to attempt to open the first Orbbec depth sensor device. If the camera fails to open, an error message is displayed, and the program exits.

- **Retrieve Camera Intrinsic Parameters**:
  Using `obsensorCapture.get()` to retrieve the intrinsic parameters of the camera, including focal lengths (`fx`, `fy`) and principal points (`cx`, `cy`).

- **Loop to Grab and Process Data**:
  In an infinite loop, the code continuously grabs data from the camera. The `obsensorCapture.grab()` method attempts to grab a frame.

- **Process RGB Image**:
  Using `obsensorCapture.retrieve(image, CAP_OBSENSOR_BGR_IMAGE)` to retrieve the RGB image data. If successfully retrieved, the RGB image is displayed in a window using `imshow("RGB", image)`.

- **Process Depth Image**:
  Using `obsensorCapture.retrieve(depthMap, CAP_OBSENSOR_DEPTH_MAP)` to retrieve the depth image data. If successfully retrieved, the depth image is normalized and a false color image is applied, then the result is displayed in a window using `imshow("DEPTH", adjDepthMap)`. The retrieved depth values are in millimeters and are truncated to a range between 300 and 5000 (millimeter).
  This fixed range can be interpreted as a truncation based on the depth camera's measurement limits, potentially enhancing the visualization's relevance to a specific depth range.

- **Overlay Depth Map on RGB Image**:
  Convert the depth map to an 8-bit image, resize it to match the RGB image size, and overlay it on the RGB image with a specified transparency (`alpha`). The overlaid image is displayed in a window using `imshow("DepthToColor", image)`.

- **Keyboard Interrupt**:
  Using `pollKey()` to detect keyboard events. If a key is pressed, the loop breaks and the program ends.

- **Release Resources**:
  After exiting the loop, the camera resources are released.

### Note

1. If the camera fails to open, please first check the camera permissions under Privacy and Security settings. If an adapter is used, ensure the related drivers are functioning correctly.
2. Do not run the code simultaneously with Orbbec's proprietary software, as this will result in resource conflicts with the camera.
3. If the code does not run successfully, try restarting your device.
4. OpenCV version 4.10 or newer is required.
5. Mac users need sudo privileges to execute the code.
